------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | --------
**1 (Opening)** | Close-up of frustrated person struggling to attach a screenshot to an email. Mouse clicks frantically, error message pops up.  | "The Old Way…" | Frantic mouse clicks, frustrated sigh.  | 3 seconds
**2** |  Person drags screenshot to desktop, renames it, struggles to upload it to a hosting site. Progress bar crawls slowly.  | "…Slow & Painful" | Slow, grinding sound effect.  | 4 seconds
**3** |  Animation: Clock hands spinning rapidly backwards as person stares blankly at screen. |  "Too Much Time" | Ticking clock, then a comical "WHOOSH" sound. | 3 seconds
**4 (Solution)** |  Clean, minimalist screen recording showing a user taking a screenshot. Then instantly, a notification pops up. | "QuickDrop" |  Camera shutter sound, followed by a crisp "ding" or notification sound. | 3 seconds
**5** |  Close-up of the notification showing the link already copied to the clipboard. Person smiles. |  "Screenshots to Links - 1 Second" | Satisfying "click" sound, followed by upbeat music increasing in tempo. | 3 seconds
